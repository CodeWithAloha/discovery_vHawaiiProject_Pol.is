Description

The vHawaii Project is a grassroots experiment to reimagine the way democratic political engagement and policy generation is approached in Hawai’i through the embrace of technology and online engagement. Our state is at a crossroads, requiring our community and leaders to make critical decisions for our state. However, traditional attempts at engaging with the community in meaningful dialogues have been failing us. From TMT to affordable housing development, there has been a disconnect between the decision making process relied on by local elected officials and the wishes of various community groups. This makes traditional decision making tools both unreliable for state leaders, and unrepresentative for local communities, paralyzing decision making and limiting progress in our state.

Drawing inspiration from the vTaiwan project, undertaken by engaged citizens and implemented by the national government in Taiwan, the vHawaii project is experimenting with the vTaiwan process to improve, simplify, and adjust the framework to fit Hawai’i's unique cultural and political circumstances by Fall 2022. vHawaii is aiming to develop an efficient, nuanced, and transparent policy generation process embedded within state government that policymakers and community members alike can rely on for the state’s biggest decisions, grounded firmly in the principles of consensus-based decision making.
